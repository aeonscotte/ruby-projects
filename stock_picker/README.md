# Stock Picker

The next logical evolution of this project is to build myself a 
simple command line application that I can use to buy and sell 
stocks, as well as simulate outcomes of trades. It could tell me
how much I bought the stock at, it's current price, display my
investments, current sale price, projected profits, and calculate
taxes.
